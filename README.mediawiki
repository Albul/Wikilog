= Requirements =

* MediaWiki 1.19-1.21 or higher, or Mediawiki4Intranet 1.18.
* A MySQL database backend.

= Installation =

* Download the extension and install it as `./extensions/Wikilog`
* Backup your database and local configuration, it is always a good idea
* Add minimal configuration to your LocalSettings.php (100 should be the first unused in your wiki namespace number):
  require_once( 'extensions/Wikilog/Wikilog.php' );
  Wikilog::setupBlogNamespace( 100 );
* (Optional) You can override some configuration from WikilogDefaultSettings.php
* Run the `php maintenance/update.php` script in order to create or update the tables used by the extension.

== Updating ==

Always run php maintenance/update.php when you're updating Wikilog. Some of the updates
may not need it, bun an extra run will never harm :)

If you are upgrading from one of previous versions of Wikilog, you should also run

  php maintenance/patchSql.php extensions/Wikilog/archives/fill-wikilog-comment-meta.sql

in your Wiki document root. This command should be only run once.
